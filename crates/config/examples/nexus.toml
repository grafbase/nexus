# Minimal Nexus configuration for Docker
# This configuration starts a basic Nexus service with MCP support

[server]
# Bind to all interfaces on port 3000 for container networking
listen_address = "0.0.0.0:3000"

[server.health]
# Enable health endpoint for container health checks
enabled = true
path = "/health"

[mcp]
# Enable Model Context Protocol support
enabled = true
# MCP endpoint will be available at /mcp
path = "/mcp"

# No MCP servers are configured by default
# Users can add their own servers by extending this configuration
