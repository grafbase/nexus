# Nexus 0.1.3 - July 28, 2025

## Summary
This patch release addresses critical configuration handling issues and reduces log verbosity for a better operational experience. The release also includes further improvements to the CI/CD pipeline.

## Bug Fixes

**Technical Details:**
- Added explicit error checking after configuration parsing
- Proper error propagation to main function
- Clear error messages indicating the exact parsing issue
- Prevents the server from starting with invalid configuration

## Enhancements/Improvements
