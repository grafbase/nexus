# Nexus 0.1.0 - July 28, 2025

## Summary
The initial release of Nexus, an AI router that aggregates MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and LLMs. This foundational release establishes the core infrastructure for MCP endpoint aggregation, tool discovery and execution, security features, and multiple server communication protocols.

## New Features

### MCP Endpoint Aggregation
**User Impact:** Connect and aggregate multiple MCP servers through a single unified interface, supporting both Server-Sent Events (SSE) and Streamable HTTP protocols.

**Technical Details:**
- Implemented core MCP router in `crates/mcp/` for managing downstream connections
- Support for multiple protocol types (SSE, Streamable HTTP)
- Concurrent downstream server initialization for improved performance
- Files created: MCP router crate structure with protocol handlers

### Search and Execute Tools
**User Impact:** Discover available tools across all connected MCP servers using keyword search, and execute tools with proper routing to the appropriate downstream server.

**Technical Details:**
- Tantivy-based full-text search engine integration for tool indexing
- Dynamic tool discovery on server initialization
- Tool execution routing with request/response handling
- Performance: Sub-millisecond search responses for typical tool queries

### Security Features
**User Impact:** Enhanced security with CORS/CSRF protection, token-based authentication for downstream servers, and OAuth2 protected resource implementation.

**Technical Details:**
- CORS middleware implementation with configurable origins
- CSRF token validation for state-changing operations
- JWT-based token authentication for downstream MCP servers
- OAuth2 resource server with issuer/audience validation
- Files modified: Authentication module in server crate

### Health Endpoint
**User Impact:** Monitor server status and readiness through a dedicated health check endpoint at `/health`.

**Technical Details:**
- Simple HTTP endpoint returning server status
- Integration with monitoring and orchestration tools
- Response includes version information and uptime

### TLS/mTLS Support
**User Impact:** Secure communication with both the Nexus server and downstream MCP servers using TLS encryption and mutual TLS authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- Rustls integration for native TLS support
- Configurable TLS settings for server and client connections
- Support for custom CA certificates
- mTLS client certificate authentication for downstream servers

### Streamable HTTP Server
**User Impact:** Host MCP tools through a Streamable HTTP interface for compatibility with various client implementations.

**Technical Details:**
- Full implementation of MCP Streamable HTTP protocol
- Bidirectional streaming support
- Efficient message framing and parsing

## Infrastructure

### Project Structure
**User Impact:** Well-organized codebase with clear separation of concerns for maintainability and extensibility.

**Technical Details:**
- Cargo workspace setup with multiple crates
- Binary crate (`nexus/`) for application entry point
- Server crate (`crates/server/`) for shared HTTP components
- Config crate (`crates/config/`) for TOML-based configuration
- MCP crate (`crates/mcp/`) for protocol implementation

## Known Limitations

### Not Working in 0.1.0
- Standard input/output (STDIO) server and downstream support
- SSE server implementation (downstream works, server only supports Streamable HTTP)
- Downstream OAuth2 authentication flow

## Dependencies
- Initial dependencies include:
  - `tokio` - Async runtime
  - `axum` - Web framework
  - `tantivy` - Search engine
  - `rmcp` - Rust MCP implementation
  - `rustls` - TLS support
  - `logforth` - Structured logging
  - `serde` - Serialization
  - `toml` - Configuration parsing
