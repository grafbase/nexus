# Nexus 0.1.5 - July 31, 2025

## Summary
This release introduces major new functionality with STDIO support for MCP servers and OAuth2 token forwarding for downstream authentication. These features significantly expand Nexus's compatibility with different MCP server implementations and enable secure access to protected resources.

## New Features

### STDIO Support
**User Impact:** Connect to MCP servers that communicate via standard input/output (STDIO) instead of HTTP, greatly expanding the range of compatible MCP implementations including many command-line tools and local servers.

**Technical Details:**
- Full implementation of STDIO protocol for downstream MCP servers
- Process management for spawning and communicating with STDIO servers
- Automatic protocol detection based on configuration
- Bi-directional JSON-RPC communication over pipes
- Files created: STDIO handler in MCP router crate
- Performance: Minimal overhead for local process communication

### OAuth2 Token Forwarding
**User Impact:** Securely access downstream MCP servers that require authentication by automatically forwarding OAuth2 tokens from incoming requests.

**Technical Details:**
- Automatic extraction of bearer tokens from incoming requests
- Token forwarding to downstream servers in Authorization headers
- Support for user-specific dynamic tool access
- Maintains security isolation between different users
- Files modified: Authentication middleware and downstream client

## Enhancements/Improvements

### Default Build Configuration
**User Impact:** Developers can now simply run `cargo run` without specifying the package name, streamlining the development workflow.

**Technical Details:**
- Set `nexus` as the default-run package in workspace
- Simplified development commands
- No impact on release builds or functionality

## Bug Fixes

### Cross-compilation Issues
**User Impact:** More reliable builds across different architectures, especially for ARM64 deployments.

**Technical Details:**
- Fixed zstd assembly compilation issues on cross-compilation
- Re-enabled sccache for aarch64 builds improving build times
- Resolved architecture-specific build failures
- Better support for multi-architecture Docker images

### CI/CD Docker Builds
**User Impact:** Consistent and reliable Docker images for each release.

**Technical Details:**
- Fixed docker-main workflow execution on releases
- Prevented duplicate builds during release process
- Improved build caching and layer optimization

## Dependencies
