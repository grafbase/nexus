# Nexus 0.1.6 - July 31, 2025

## Summary
This patch release removes a confusing configuration option for STDIO MCP servers, simplifying the setup process and preventing configuration errors. Additional improvements to documentation and CI/CD workflows are included.

## Bug Fixes

### STDIO Configuration Simplification
**User Impact:** Removed the `stdout` configuration option from STDIO MCP servers as it must always be "pipe" for proper MCP JSON-RPC communication, eliminating a common source of configuration errors.

**Technical Details:**
- Removed unnecessary `stdout` field from STDIO server configuration
- Hardcoded stdout to always use "pipe" mode internally
- Simplified configuration schema for STDIO servers
- Prevents misconfiguration that would break JSON-RPC communication
- Files modified: STDIO configuration handling in config crate

## Infrastructure/DevOps Changes

### CI/CD Workflow Fixes
**User Impact:** More reliable automated releases and Docker image publishing.

**Technical Details:**
- Fixed docker-main workflow execution during releases
- Improved workflow conditions to prevent duplicate runs
- Better error handling in release automation
- Consistent GitHub release creation

## Documentation

### README Updates
**User Impact:** Clearer project documentation with improved formatting and visual presentation.

**Technical Details:**
- Fixed README header formatting issues
- Updated project tagline for clarity
- Improved logo placement and styling
- Better overall documentation structure

## Deployment Notes
- **Breaking Change for STDIO configurations**: Remove any `stdout` field from STDIO server configurations
- The system will now automatically use the correct stdout configuration
- Existing STDIO servers will continue to work after removing the configuration option
- No other breaking changes or functional modifications
